# Celeris

![Celeris Logo](docs/assets/celeris-main.png)

Celeris is a high-performance backend technology built with C++. Inspired by the Latin word for "fast" or "rapid," Celeris is designed to provide developers with a modern and efficient way to build backend APIs, similar to popular frameworks like FastAPI or Node.js, but with the power and speed of C++.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Leveraging the speed of C++, Celeris provides fast and efficient API handling for high-demand applications.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Easily define routes for your application, supporting both GET and POST methods out of the box.
- **JSON Handling**: Built-in support for JSON serialization and deserialization using the nlohmann JSON library.
- **Extensible**: Modular design allows easy addition of new features and extensions.

## Installation

Celeris is designed to be easy to set up without the need for separately installing Boost or nlohmann JSON, as these dependencies are included in the project itself.

### Install Celeris

To get started with Celeris, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alazar42/Celeris.git
   cd Celeris
   ```

2. **Build the Project**:

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

   This will automatically use the included Boost and nlohmann JSON libraries, so you donâ€™t need to install them separately.

## Getting Started

Here's a basic example of setting up a simple server with Celeris:

```cpp
#include <celeris/celeris.hpp>

int main() {
    // Create a Celeris server instance
    Celeris app(8080, "127.0.0.1");

    // Define a simple GET route
    app.get("/hello", [](const Request& req, Response& res) {
        nlohmann::json json_response = {{"message", "Hello, world!"}};
        res.set_json(json_response);
    });

    // Define a POST route
    app.post("/echo", [](const Request& req, Response& res) {
        nlohmann::json json_request = nlohmann::json::parse(req.body);
        res.set_json(json_request);
    });

    // Start the server
    app.listen();

    return 0;
}

```
